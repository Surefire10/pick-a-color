Pick-a-color is a browser extension made to help designers and artists get the color codes of any
pixel on their screen using the eyedrop tool.

as a user, you can then adjust the opacity and hue of your selected color, or pick a completely different one
using the built-in color-picker!

Pick-a-color was built using pure Javascript utilizing native Eyedropper API and Coloris.js
